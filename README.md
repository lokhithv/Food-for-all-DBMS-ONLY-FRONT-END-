# Food-for-All-FFA-DBMS-project
This project involves developing a website aimed at facilitating food donation for individuals in need. The platform includes three types of user logins: donors, orphanages, and volunteers.  Donors contribute food, orphanages request food donations, and volunteers coordinate the delivery of donated food to those in need.
